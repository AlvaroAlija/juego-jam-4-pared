# Not This Time

Not This Time is a 2D puzzle-platformer designed for a game jam with the theme "Breaking the Fourth Wall".  
In this game, the protagonist refuses to obey typical platforming conventions. Instead of following your commands, the character breaks the fourth wall by changing the control scheme, forcing you to adapt and discover new ways to play.

The game consists of 10 progressively challenging levels, each with randomized or altered controls. Your goal is to experiment with the keys, figure out the new control system, and complete all the levels.

The game is designed to surprise players, subvert expectations, and inject humor by making the character interact directly with you, the player.
